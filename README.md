# Reddit Karma Blocker

Reduces unintended use of Reddit scores for value judgment. By hiding it and associated controls.

Reddit measures posts, comments or users popularity by a numerical score system called karma. It is often used as a shortcut to measure the value of the content. This phenomenon introduces a herd mentality. What is already popular will be up voted. Not because people have actually considered the value of content. But because it is popular. This includes suppressing content. Not because there is an actual value judgment. But because the content is being popularly suppressed.
